# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the following analysis is to provide a breakdown of the ride-sharing data by city type for the data sharing company PyBer. The intent of the analysis is to  show how the  data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
Throughout the analysis we have gathered the following data points that will be helpful in determining improvements for PyBer;  the total rides totaling 2375, total drivers 2,973, total fares totaling $63,538.64, average fare per ride totaling $30.04, and average fare by driver totaling $37.18. In addition,  we've also determined the total fare by city type to be:
* Rural: $4327.93
* Suburban: $19,356.33
* Urban:$39,854.38

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the analysis and data points we can gather that urban cities by far have the highest number of total drivers yet the average fare per ride seems to be the lowest of all cities at $24.53 compared to rural cities at $34.62 per ride. Based on this evidence it would be prudent for PyBer to consider increasing the number of drivers in rural cities. Increasing the number of drivers at a minimum on the two months with the highest fare totals of March and April would be a great start to increase total fares in rural cities.
